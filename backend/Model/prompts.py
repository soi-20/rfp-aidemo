1. "ServiceFM fully supports this approach and will commit to developing a schedule of site visits during the Transition Period to be attended by the dedicated Facilities’ Manager and the State based Client Services representative. 

We propose to use the existing Lifeblood team of Client Services Managers as they already know your sites and teams and have a site visit program in place. We will cross train them to support FM services being delivered and so they understand any audit requirements and can report back to the FM team. We can bring in specialists when required for particular issue management which is more technical. 

Bringing the current program of site visits under the one management will provide added value to Lifeblood as additional pairs of eyes at a site level, more regularly than we could achieve as two individual contracts. Although we recognise that some specialist knowledge may be required, we think the benefits here outweigh the training challenges it may provide. 
Guided by you, we would suggest a program of site visits is agreed early in the Transition Period for our representatives to attend nominated sites to better understand Lifeblood’s operations and building related issues. We would also recommend setting up a program of joint inspections of key Lifeblood sites between our Account Manager and the Lifeblood contract representative, as an opportunity to highlight any issues, understand complex site requirements at a deeper level and share learnings."
"Fully complies."

2. "In summary: ServiceFM take Modern Slavery seriously and this is one of our high priorities. As a company, we pay award rates according to Fair Work Australia and we expect our supply chains to prove they are adhering to the Modern Slavery Act and practices.

We have a Modern Slavery Policy in place and a Contract Management Procedure which outlines how we screen and assess our suppliers. 

As part of vetting our subcontractors, they are required to fill out a Contractor Commencement Request Form, which requires subcontractor companies to answer questions in relation to Modern Slavery and their operations. Only contractors that meet our vetting process and our HSEQ standards are approved for engagement.

We have a reporting channel for our staff, contractors, and clients to address grievance, complaints and issues related to modern slavery. This is evident in our Whistle Blower Policy which documents to whom and how reports can be made. We also provide training for our staff related to adhering to the Modern Slavery Act and our policies and the mechanisms available for complaints and issues.
The Facilities Manager and Client Managers in each state are individually responsible for ensuring our contractors are working in accord with the Modern Slavery Act. Escalation and complaints are referred to our General Manager and HSEQ Manager to review and address any complaints or concerns in relation to Modern Slavery. Any complaints received during the Lifeblood contract would be input into our ServiceFM 360 system, via the Helpdesk, and assigned a ticket ID and escalated straight to our dedicated Facilities Manager for actioning."

        Training Material: {context} 

        In the instance that you are unsure, you must answer the question to the extent of your knowledge. 

        YOU MUST ONLY ANSWER BASED ON THE TRAINING MATERIAL 

      Follow these instructions:  

      Summarise this document into 5 single sentence bullet points. 

      Here are examples of the how you should structure and phrase the summaries (leave out a line between each bullet point):

      Example 1: context of the business case:

      1. The demand for prison beds continues to increase and will soon exceed the
      Department’s available capacity, despite recent capacity additions.

      2. Targeted legislative and policy changes have successfully slowed the rate of growth in
      demand, however not sufficiently to remove the pressure on capacity.

      3. The Department is faced with existing capacity that is no longer fit for purpose and
      requires replacement.
      
      4. Under increasing pressure, the Department has continued to manage the muster across
      all classifications of prisoner, through just in time, resource-intensive operational logistics and adjustments across the prison network.

      5. In order to shape this response, the Business Case has developed a set of Capacity
      Principles. These provide a measure against which all feasible capacity responses can
      be evaluated to ensure alignment with the Department’s requirements.

      Example 2: 

      1. The implementation plan for traditional build components is based on the considerable
      experience that the Department has developed in this area.

      2. Collaboration with Central Agencies to deliver the PPP activities identified within the implementation approach will be crucial to achieving timeframes and a successful
      outcome

      3. Separate governance for traditional build components and for the PPP build component is
      in place. These governance structures will ensure that subject matter expertise and advice
      is best applied.

      4. Certain programme activities, such as PMO support and quality assurance processes, will
      be common or shared between the traditional build components and the PPP build
      component.

      5. To maintain flexibility, the implementation approach includes several check points and
      potential off-ramps that will enable the Department to change the timing or detail of the
      investment required over the course of the programme.

      Example 3: 

      1. The total 10 year programme capital requirement is $820 million. The operating requirement
      to support this is $858 million.

      2. The operating cost is a net figure and includes reallocation of funding for prisoner related
      costs of $244 million over the 10 year period as a result of decommissioning end of life
      stock and associated replacement.

      3. For Budget 2010, the total capital investment is $408 million to deliver the proposed Mt Eden
      Phase 2 and Wiri components. The Department will self fund the full capital cost of $83
      million for Mt Eden Phase 2.

      4. For Budget 2011, capital costs of $272 million are required to deliver the proposed Waikeria
      developments.

      5. While alternative procurement options have been assessed, capital and operating costs are
      based on a traditional design and build procurement option.
